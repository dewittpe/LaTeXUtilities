	abstract = {Uncertainty surrounding the error covariance matrix often presents the biggest barrier to achieving accurate power analysis in the 'univariate' approach to repeated measures analysis of variance ({UNIREP).} A poor choice gives either an overpowered study which wastes resources, or an underpowered study with little chance of success. Internal pilot designs were introduced to resolve such uncertainty about error variance for t-tests. In earlier papers, we extended the use of internal pilots to any univariate linear model with fixed predictors and independent Gaussian errors. Here we further extend our exact and approximate results to {UNIREP} analysis. For a fixed treatment effect, the inaccuracy in a power calculation depends only on the ratio of the true variance to the value used for planning. The greater complexity of repeated measures requires generalizing misspecification of error variance to the misspecification of the eigenvalues of the error covariance. We recommend approximating the misspecification in terms of the first and second moments of the eigenvalues, for both fixed sample and internal pilot designs. We also describe an unadjusted approach for internal pilots with repeated measures. Simulations illustrate the fact that both positive and negative properties in the univariate setting extend to repeated measures analysis. In particular, internal pilots allow maintaining power or reducing expected sample size when the covariance matrix used for planning differs from the true value. However, an unadjusted approach can inflate test size, at least with small to moderate sample sizes. Hence new, adjusted methods must be developed for small samples. At this time, we caution against using an internal pilot design with repeated measures without first conducting simulations to document the amount of test size inflation possible for the conditions of interest.},

	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood ({REML)} estimation is a method employed to estimate variance-covariance parameters from data that follow a Gaussian linear model. In applications, it has either been conjectured or assumed that {REML} estimators are asymptotically Gaussian with zero mean and variance matrix equal to the inverse of the restricted information matrix. In this article, we give conditions under which the conjecture is true and apply our results to variance-components models. An important application of variance components is to census undercount; a simulation is carried out to verify {REML′s} properties for a typical census undercount model.},

	abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R2 statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R2 statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R2 statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R2 statistic arises as a 1–1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model to a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R2 statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R2 statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R2, a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated blood pressure outcomes for the study.},
